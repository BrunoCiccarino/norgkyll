Welcome aboard! NorgKyll is your go-to tool for converting Neorg files (`.norg`) into beautiful, fully-functional static websites. Whether you're a Markdown veteran or new to structured text, NorgKyll bridges the gap between simplicity and power.  

---

## What is Neorg? ü§î  

Think of [Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) as a supercharged Markdown. It‚Äôs a markup format designed for note-taking, life management, and pretty much anything else you can express in plaintext. Neorg works seamlessly with Neovim, making it a breeze to create, edit, and organize your notes.  

---

### Neorg in a Nutshell  

**Basic Syntax**  
- Any plain text is allowed. Example: "This is my note!"  

**Inline Markup**  
- Style your text easily: bold, italic, underline, superscript, subscript, etc.  

**Lists**  
- Create unordered or ordered lists with simple syntax.  

**Headings and Nesting**  
- Use asterisks for headings, and indent for nested content.  

**Tasks (TODOs)**  
- Turn lists into actionable tasks with TODO states: undone, done, urgent, on hold, etc.  

---

## What is NorgKyll? üåü  

While Neorg helps you create structured content, NorgKyll lets you share it by generating a static website from your `.norg` files.  

---

2. **Run the CLI**
