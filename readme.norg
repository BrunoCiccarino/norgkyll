** What is Neorg? ü§î

Think of {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg}[Neorg] as a supercharged Markdown. It‚Äôs a markup format designed for note-taking, life management, and pretty much anything else you can express in plaintext. Neorg works seamlessly with Neovim, making it a breeze to create, edit, and organize your notes. 


___

*** Neorg in a Nutshell

*Basic Syntax*

- Any plain text is allowed. Example: "This is my note!" 


*Inline Markup*

- Style your text easily: bold, italic, underline, superscript, subscript, etc. 


*Lists*

- Create unordered or ordered lists with simple syntax. 


*Headings and Nesting*

- Use asterisks for headings, and indent for nested content. 


*Tasks (TODOs)*

- Turn lists into actionable tasks with TODO states: undone, done, urgent, on hold, etc.
